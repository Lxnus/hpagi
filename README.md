# HPAGI - High Performance Artificial General Intelligence
HPAGI is a theory about an universal reinforcement learning agent.
The theory is based on an approximation of MCTS and combinations of (Hidden) Markov Model, Hopfield,
Bayesian Networks, different Deep learning algorithms and own algorithms.

Maybe in future AIXI would be part of the theory. 

### The project is not complete! 
### The theory is not a final solution and not yet completely implemented!
